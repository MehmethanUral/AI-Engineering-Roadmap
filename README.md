# 🚀 6-Month AI Engineering Roadmap

This repository documents my journey to becoming an AI Engineer in 6 months. I am following a structured roadmap covering Python fundamentals, Mathematics for AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and MLOps.

> **Current Status:** Month 2 (Machine Learning) -  
> **Goal:** Consistent weekly projects and deep understanding of AI concepts.
